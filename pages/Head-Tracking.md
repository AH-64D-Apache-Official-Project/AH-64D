# Head tracking mode

As we know many of our users use tools like [TrackIR](https://www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/) to allow for in-game head movement, we have tried to add features that allow for improvements to their experience. That is why you will see an option called `Toggle Head Tracking On` in your action menu when in the helicopter. When selected, it adds a few small quality of life improvements:

## PNVS

Rather than using your mouse input to move the PNVS, the position is instead read from your head tracker, like it is in the real aircraft. This makes the PNVS smoother to operate while flying, and means that mouse inputs will not affect it.

## Cockpit action free-look

Rather than your mouse moving the PNVS as it does with head tracking disabled, the mouse now controls the position of the click action crosshair (![x](images/tex/center-cursor.png)) around your screen. This allows for you to move your head to look at the rough area of the item you would like to click, and then make the more accurate movement onto the control with the mouse.

If you have moved the crosshair while in head tracking mode, and turn off head tracking mode, the crosshair will stay wherever it was last.

> :information_source: if you would like to re-center the crosshair, all you need to do is press the "Look Center" button (by default [Num 5].) This works both in and out of head tracking mode.
