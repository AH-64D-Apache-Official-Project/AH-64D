Since the Apache mod aims for realism in as many places as possible we use a lot of terms and acronyms for their specificity and shortness. Unfortunately, some of these can seem obscure without knowing what they mean. Here is a list of such terms and their definitions in this context:

| Term | Definition |
| :-- | :-- |
| APU | Auxiliary Power unit - a small gas turbine engine that doesn't provide propulsion, and is only used to provide the power and pressure necessary to start up the Apache. It is turned off during flight |
| CPG | Copilot gunner - the front seater |
| DP | Display processor |
| EUFD / UFD | Enhanced up front display / up front display - the small display above the right-hand MPD. It statically displays important data like WCAs / radio channels / time / fuel etc.
| FCR | LONGBOW Fire Control Radar - Automatic Target Detection, Location, Classification and Prioritization.  Rapid , multi-target engagement in all weather.  Target coordinates are automatically available to other sensors and weapons for target confirmation, rapid engagement, and reduced fratricide. | 
| HDU | Helmet Display Unit |
| HMD | Head mounted display - the monocle display attached to the cockpit that displays the IHADSS' interface |
| IHADSS | Integrated Helmet and Display Sight System - the helmet mounted display that the Apache uses. |
| KU | Keyboard unit. The small keyboard on the left hand side of the cockpit. (:construction: not currently implemented) |
| LRFD | Laser rangefinder / designator. Part of the TADS. |
| MPD | Multi-purpose display. The two displays that are visible in both the PLT and CPG seat. These are the operator's primary method of accessing avionics and targeting information |
| NTS | Next-to-shoot. The selected target on the FCR. It is the target that will be locked if an AGM-114L missile as launched. |
| PFZ | Priority fire zone - a zone that can be designated on the TSD as an area of interest. It can be then used to filter the display by area, or you can transmit targets in the area to another Apache. |
| PLT | Pilot. Back-seater in the aircraft |
| PNVS | Pilot Night Vision System - The small camera above the TADS that the pilot has control of. |
| SAL | Semi active laser - type of laser guidance used by the majority of the AGM-114 hellfire missiles (other than the L model.) Comes in two variants (SAL-1 and SAL-2) depending on the generation of the guidance system |
| TADS | Target Acquisition and Designation System - The large camera system on the nose of the aircraft. It provides the more advanced optics used by the CPG to find targets (like high magnification day TV and thermal optics.) It also contains the laser designation system. |
| TSD | Tactical situation display - an MPD page that allows for you to view waypoints and targets in a map-like environment. |
| WCA | Warning, Caution, Advisory - the 3 types of status messages that the Apache's systems can provide. They are visible either on the EUFD or on the WCA page on an MFD. They can range from warnings (Engine out) to smaller advisories (canopy door open.) |
