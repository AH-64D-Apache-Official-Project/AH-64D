The ENG page is your view into the engines, drivetrain and rotor system. It is invaluable during startup and is useful during flight to ensure you do not over-torque the engines.

Most information here is provided both visually and graphically, via the vertical tapes. Many of them are also colour-coded (red, amber, green) to give another indication of help

## Info
The boxes in Figure 1 are numbered and their explanations are provided below.
1. Torque % : It shows the torque level for each engine, with their numerical values being displayed above the tapes. The player can exceed the maximum value of 100% for each or both engines for a maximum of 6-8 seconds after which the engine will start to fail with a loss of torque.
2. TGT \*C : Indicates the turbine gas temperature. This value will increase with the torque value.
3. NP % and NR % : Engine turbine and main rotor RPM values and tapes respectively. Normal values are 101% for both NP and NR. The numerical value for NR is shown in the centre but for NP it is shown beside and under as seen in Box 4.
4. NP % : Numerical values for NP for engines 1 and 2.
5. NG % : Generator turbine shaft's RPM shown in percentage of maximum shft RPM.
6. Engine Oil PSI : Oil pressure for engines 1 and 2.
7. Hydraulic PSI : Hydraulic pressure for Primary, utilities and accumulator pressure. These values are important as they dictate the usage of control surfaces for the helicopter. If the hydraulic pressure starts to fall, land immediately and repair the helicopter.


## Operations

The player can access the FLT, FUEL, PERF and UTIL pages from here.
