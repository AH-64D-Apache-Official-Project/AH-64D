## Introduction
This page will explain the UTIL page found alongside the engine pages of the Apache helicopter.

## Information

### FMC
On the left, the pilot can change which systems the flight managment computer (FMC) can control for a smoother flight. This is similar to FADEC for controlling the rotors. The following can be toggled.
1. Pitch
2. Roll
3. Yaw
4. Coll [?]
5. Trim

### Anti-Ice
Icing is not simulated in Arma 3, so these do not have any effect nor do they function. They are mostly used to heat the systems to prevent ice from forming on or in them.

### FAT and PLT CKPT TEMP
These display the Free air temperature (FAT) and the temperature inside the cockpit. These are static values and do not change with any change in the environment. Cockpit temperature is shown in Fahrenheit.

### Bleed Air and ECS
This controls from which engine is bleed air being used from. Bleed air is used for maintaining environmental control allowing for optimum usage.

ECS denotes whether the environmental control system is active. Cannot be changed by the player.

### GND
