The FCR page shows all targets that have been discovered by the FCR, along with a number indicating the quantity of discovered targets in the top right.

The FCR does not follow the same zoom levels as the TSD and ASE page, and is constantly scaled so that the edge of the radar is the maximum range of the radar.

The background image showing FCR range and scan size will change depending on FCR mode.

## Operations

No direct operations can be performed through the FCR page, but the FCR can be instead operated via [keybinds](keybinds.html)
