## Introduction
The FUEL page is used to manage and view the aircraft's fuel. On the FUEL page you can see fuel levels, consumption rates and endurance times.

{% include important.html content="Currently the mod does include the auxillary fuel tanks which are pylon mounted. These are not self-sealing so when under fire they will blow up." %}
