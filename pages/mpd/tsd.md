## Introduction

The TSD, or tactical situation display, is one of the pages you will find yourself heavily using. It is where any waypoints you make will be displayed, along with where all your targeting information generated by the FCR is stored.

It can be in one of two modes, either ATK or NAV. In ATK, it is going to show you targeting information while in NAV it is going to show you waypoints.

{% include important.html content="In reality in the real aircraft the distinction between the two modes is less defined, you can see most things in both situations but in game this is not the case both for simplicity's sake and due to technical limitations." %}

{% include warning.html content="The TSD can only show up to 32 targets or waypoints due to technical limitations of the engine. If you have more targets than that known to you, you may not be able to view them all. If this occurs, use the FLTR option to filter down the list of targets so it is smaller." %}

## Info

### ATK mode (Figure 1)

1. Current bearing of the helicopter.
2. Current zoom level of the map.
3. The current filter applied to the targets appearing in ATK mode.
4. The currently selected target
5. Another target, not selected.
6. Distance to the target
7. Wind bearing and speed (in knots)
8. The current Priority Fire Zone selected.
9. The current mode the aircraft is in.
10. The bearing from the nose of the aircraft to the currently selected target
11. Current distance to the selected target. In addition to this, when in transit, an ETA will appear below it.

### NAV mode (Figure 2)
11. Current distance to the selected waypoint. In addition to this, when in transit, an ETA will appear below it.
12. Home waypoint (`00`.) This is set by where the helicopter spawns in, and even clearing all waypoints will keep this one.
13. The currently selected waypoint (`01`.) You can tell it is currently selected by the circle below the number being filled in, rather than hollow.

### Target types

Here is a table of all types of targets, how they will look in different situations and their name as a type.

## Operations

### Common operations

#### Zooming in and out

1. Use the up and down arrows (R1 / R2 respectively) to adjust to your needs

#### Switching modes (ATK/NAV)

1. Press the ATK/NAV button (B1)

#### Toggling map

1. Press the MAP button (B3)

{% include warning.html content="On some modded maps this feature may not work. To decide upon what map texture to use, we rely on the terrain maker to have the `pictureMap` field in their `CfgWorlds` entry. If this is not present, we cannot decide what map texture to use in the background. For the same reason we cannot decide what style the resultant map will be in" %}

### NAV operations
#### Adding a waypoint

1) Click the ADD button (L1)
2) Open up the map with the M key on your keyboard
3) Left click on the location you would like to add as a waypoint.

{% include tip.html content="You can add multiple waypoints, just click one after the other." %}

4) Press the XMIT (L3) button to finalise waypoint addition:

#### Clearing a waypoint

1. Double tap the DEL button on the MPD (L2)

{% include tip.html content="Clearing all waypoints will not clear the home (`00`) waypoint." %}

#### Importing waypoints from group orders

If you are in a group with a commander, that commander can assign you waypoints like they would any other infantryman using the default ARMA command system. You can, once you have those orders, import them into the apache NAV system.

1. Once you have your orders, click the RTE button (B4)

{% include warning.html content="Doing this will reset your home position to the position your helicopter was at when you received orders." %}

### ATK operations

#### Filtering targets

1. Click on the FLTR button (R3) to cycle between all different filter options.

The following options are available for filtering targets:

| Filter Name | Icon | Description |
| :- | :-: | :- |
| All | ![](images/tex/mpd/ALL.png) | No filter is applied
| Tracked vehicles | ![](images/tex/mpd/TRacK.png) | Only vehicles with tracks are displayed 
| Radiation sources | ![](images/tex/mpd/RADiation.png) | Radiation sources (radar sites)
| Wheel | ![](images/tex/mpd/WHeeL.png) | Wheeled vehicles
| PFZs 1-8 | ![](images/tex/char/G1_ca.png) .. ![](images/tex/char/G8_ca.png) | Only targets in this PFZ will be shown. |

#### Adding / Editing / Using PFZs.

This is an advanced topic, and really needs its own wiki page explaining what they are and how to use them.

This feature is only really useful when you are working with multiple apaches and the other apaches don't have radar.
