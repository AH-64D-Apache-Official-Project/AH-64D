# Mod Setup

This is a tutorial on how to set up the AH-64D Apache Project mod for ArmA 3. This is short, but essential to do if you want to fly this aircraft!

## Key bindings

Due to how many features this custom aircraft has, we have multiple additional keybinds that you can map. There is no default, so you will have to do this. Here is the [[full list|Keybinds]] of keybinds.


At a bare minimum, you must map "Custom User 20" - which is used to click on buttons in the cockpit. You can not fly the aircraft without it.

To do this, complete the following steps:

> :information_source: These steps can also be done from the in-game menu accessed by pressing the `Esc` key. You should not have to restart your game afterwards.

1. From the main menu go to *Options -> Controls*
2. In Controls, look at the *Custom controls* tab
3. Click on the control you would like to add, in this case 20.
4. Press the key you would like to bind to the control.
5. Press *OK* until you are back at the main menu
