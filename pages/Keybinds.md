# Key bindings

This mod adds a lot of custom controls that you can bind. What you may find though, is that not all of them are essential. Many of them are useful only to give you fast access to the control if you need it.

It is recommended at first to not set up these these controls, and instead gain practice with the mod first and as you start to want quicker access to more controls, add them then.

To see how to map controls, see our page on [Setting Up](Setting-Up)
