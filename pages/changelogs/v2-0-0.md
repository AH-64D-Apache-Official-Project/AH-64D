We are happy to say that the V2.0.0 update has been released, and with over 10,000 changed lines of code! A significant portion of the mod has been rewritten, and it has been tidied up in general.

In terms of feature count, there are not significant changes but the infrastructural changes made it will be much easier to add more exciting features in the future!

The following changes have been made:

## CBA keybindings

This mod in its history has used custom controls 1-20 for its additional controls. This has caused some issues with people getting conflicts and not being able to remap it. To fix this, we have moved across to CBA keybinds.

For 90% of you, this will make no difference. As a default, they are mapped to the custom controls that they were on originally, so you don't have to change anything if you are happy. For the 10% that do, it is just like any CBA controls, you can remap them there.

If you want to map it to a joystick, you must follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/wiki/Bind-Addon-Key-Actions-to-Joystick-Buttons).

## Click helper

The click helper has been added back into the mod, telling you the name of the control that you are over! If you prefer it out of the way, you can disable it in our CBA settings

## CBA Settings

We have added the ability to use CBA settings to customise your user experience. The two that are available currently are:

* Whether the cockpit interaction cursor moves in head tracking mode
* Cockpit cursor sensitivity in the aforementioned mode
* Whether the [SFM+ Stabilator](./flight-model-sfm-plus.html) is enabled
* Whether the on-screen popup appears
* Whether vanilla targeting information (Locking diamond, etc.) should appear.
* Whether the cockpit interaction helper is enabled

### Missile guidance

This has been rewritten. For more information on this, look at [this page](./weapons-hellfire.html)).

### Cockpit synchronisation

Where they should be, the variables on the apache have been synchronised correctly. A full audit of every variable in the mod was performed and whether it should be shared was checked. The following things are now crewstation-independent (if you change it, it will also be changed for the other pilot):

* FCR mode
* IHADSS Mode
* IHADSS Bobup mode position
* Waypoint information
* Currently selected waypoint
* Currently selected PFZ
* TSD filter

This should help crew cohesion.

### Pylons

We have moved across from using our own custom pylons system, to using a slightly more complex than usual version of the vanilla dynamic vehicle loadouts system. You can still have different rocket pod zones available.

If you wish to modify your pylons in-game, rather than in the editor, then there are plenty of mods that allow you to do so. We should be compatible with all of them, though our focus was on the ACE system and that provided by Zeus Enhanced.

### Appearance

We moved across to the vanilla garage system for our skins, so you can select them in Eden or through your favourite zeus plugin.
