WAS is short for Weapon Action Switch - the control used to 'Action' (ready for firing) a weapon.

In-game these are the {% include keybind.html name="was-m230"%}, {% include keybind.html name="was-rkt"%} and {% include keybind.html name="was-msl"%} keys for the M230, rockets and hellfires respectively.

To WAS, or action, a weapon simply press its WAS button. To De-WAS, or De-action a weapon that is actioned, just press its WAS button again.

{% include warning.html content="Even if a weapon is actioned, you **cannot fire it until the aircraft is armed**." %}

{% include important.html content="To arm/safe the aircraft, you click the arm/safe button on the **armament panel**." %}
