The M230 Chaingun is a chain-fed, hydraulically actuated 30mm autocannon attached to the underside of the aircraft. It primarily fires M789 High Explosive Dual Purpose rounds, which are capable of engaging infantry, mechanised / motorised units and lighter armoured targets.

When not in use or in the case of hydraulics failure, the weapon system will move to a stowed position of 11 degrees up through its spring loading mechanism. It will only move from this position after being actioned by either operator of the aircraft.

## Usage

The M230 can be selected by pressing {% include keybind.html name="was-m230" %}.

{% include warning.html content="If you are running ACE, then its engine off keybind is the 1 key. While not a significant issue for our mod (our engine system should automatically turn the engine back on) it is better safe than sorry and you may want to unbind it." %}

When viewing it through the TADS, you can press {% include keybind.html name="target-range" %} to use the LRFD to automatically compensate for range and velocity to target.

{% include warning.html content="If you have an enemy selected in the vanilla targeting system (they have a box around them) then you may have issues with ranging not working as expected, as it will instead compensate for that target rather than where you're currently looking." %}

The M230 will aim at whatever your [selected sight](weapons-sights.html) is.
