This page will explain the difference of the Apache provided by this mod and Apaches provided by RHS/CUP and DCS.

## Differences
1. Better than the DCS and RHS/CUP choppers. The flight model is more in line with the actual chopper and also the weapons work better.
2. DCS has the AH-64E with a digitial screen for TADS while this mod is a version behind, the AH-64D, the TADS is seen through an eyepiece at least in the game.
3. No colour output for the TADS, thermal, and black and white. Most of the times just run thermal.
4. Clicky-clicky, and buttons. Both exist, allowing for players to either interact with the mouse or use MPDs to interact with the screens.
5. Did we mention a better flight model, well here it is again. A better flight model and simulation.
6. Integrates with CBA and ACE for missile guidance and options for using the helicopter.
7. Uses the new mod keybinds from Arma 3 for interfacing with joysticks and other external peripherals.
8. NO STINGERS ON THE EXTERNAL HARDPOINTS. ASK THE INFANTRY TO CLEAR THE SKY OR USE YOUR CANNON OR LASER GUIDED HELLFIRE.

Points 1 and 5 are important, the chopper will be heavy when carrying a full load of munitions and fuel. Scarifice something to get it flying.

The mod is similar to the Hatchet H-60. H-60 is transport while the Apache is the attack helicopter. If the player is familiar with the H-60 then most of the quirks related to the flight model will be similar and will give a good jumping off point for flying the Apache.

The sub-systems on the other hand are very different and the player should devote some time to learning it.
