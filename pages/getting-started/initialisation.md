This page will explain the difference of the Apache provided by this mod and Apaches provided by RHS/CUP and DCS.

## Differences
1. Better than the DCS and RHS/CUP choppers. The flight model is more in line with the actual chopper and also the weapons work better.
2. DCS has the AH-64E with a digitial screen for TADS while this mod is a version behind, AH-64D, the tads is seen through an eyepiece at least in the game.
3. No colour output for the TADS, thermal, and black and white. Most of the times just run thermal.
4. Clicky-clicky, and buttons. Both exist, allowing for players to either interact with the mouse or use MPDs to interact with the screens.
5. Did we mention a better flight model, well here it is again. A better flight model and simulation.
6. Integrates with CBA and ACE for missile guidance and options for using the helicopter.
7. Uses the new mod keybinds from Arma 3 for interfacing with joysticks and other external peripherals.
8. NO STINGERS ON THE EXTERNAL HARDPOINTS. ASK THE INFANTRY TO CLEAR THE SKY OR USE YOUR CANNON OR LASER GUIDED HELLFIRE.

Points 1 and 5 are important, the chopper will be heavy when carrying a full load of munitions and fuel. Scarfice something to get it flying.

Now the mod is similar to the Hatchet H-60. The developers would suggest learning both as the flight models and interaction is very similar to players. Systems is where the differences start.
