# M230 Operation

![Image of the M230 Chaingun](images/weapons/m230.jpg)

The M230 Chaingun is a chain-fed, hydraulically actuated 30mm autocannon attached to the underside of the aircraft. It primarily fires M789 High Explosive Dual Purpose rounds, which are capable of engaging infantry, mechanised / motorised units and lighter armoured targets.

When not in use or in the case of hydraulics failure, the weapon system will move to a stowed position of 11 degrees up through its spring loading mechanism.

## Usage

The M230 can be selected by pressing the `Weapons Group 1` keybind, which is by default the `1` key.

> :heavy_exclamation_mark: If you are running ACE, then its engine off keybind is the 1 key. While not a significant issue for our mod (our engine system should automatically turn the engine back on) it is better safe than sorry and you may want to unbind it.

The M230 will aim at whatever your selected sight is.
