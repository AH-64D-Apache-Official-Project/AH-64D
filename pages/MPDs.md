# MPDs

The MPDs, or multi-purpose-displays are your primary method of interacting with the aircraft's avionics and weapons systems. There are two of them, the left and right side. Around them there are a series of buttons, which can be used to interact with the menus on the screen.

> :information_source: If you are in the CPG seat and your view of one of the MPDs is obstructed by the ORT, then you can adjust your seating position with Left Ctrl + [Num 4] | [Num 6]. To go back to your original position just press [Num 5]

## Buttons

Since the buttons are unlabelled, they are hard to describe when explaining what to do. The standard is to describe them using a 2 character code, like T2 or R4. The letter is the side, so either Top, Bottom, Left or Right. The numbering is done either from top to bottom or from left to right depending on the side. We will be using this explanation from here on.

## Navigation

There are a few ways to get to each MPD page:

* Some MPDs have a quick-select button in the bottom left (TSD,FCR,WPN.) You can click on these to get access.
* All pages are available on the DMS that is accessible by pressing M button that is to the bottom left of the MPD.
* Some pages have their multi-purpose buttons as links to page, as shown by the presence of a small green arrow and the page name next to the button. You can click the respective button to go to that page<sup>1</sup>

> :heavy_exclamation_mark: you can only access pages that are available on the MPD you have selected.

## Pages

While in the real aircraft, you can open any page on any MPD, due to technical limitations you can only pages from certain screens.

Here is a list of all the pages and where you can open them:

| Page | Left? | Right? | Page | Left? | Right? |
| :-- | :-: | :-: | :-- | :-: | :-: |
| DMS | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | [WCA](./MPD-Page-%23-WCA) | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
