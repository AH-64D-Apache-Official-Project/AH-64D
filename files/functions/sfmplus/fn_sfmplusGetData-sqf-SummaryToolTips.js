NDSummary.OnToolTipsLoaded("File:functions/sfmplus/fn_sfmplusGetData.sqf",{70:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TFunction LSQF\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">This function contains tables generated using 0ft PA and 15C (standard day) conditions for hover and max torque available. Cruise data was derived from the 2000ft PA and 20C chart. ARMA uses 70% throttle travel as the hover and level flight in cruise point in the SFM. The idea behind this function is to display the real values by using table interpolation. This is meant to be real time and dynamic, as the aircraft gross weight (GWT) changes, so to will the required torque.</div></div>"});
