This mod, initially developed by Franze and Nodunit for Arma 2, aims to bring as realistic an aviation experience as practicably possible to this game.

The primary features of the aircraft are:

* Fully clickable cockpit with an emphasis on core mission systems.
* Realistic displays inspired by available documentation.
* Augmented flight model.
* Easy weapons & appearance customisation.

## History

Around the time that Arma 3 was released, the original two developers moved to other projects. Since then, Sacha 'Voodooflies' Oropeza has taken over as the project lead, maintaining the project since. Since then, more developers have joined the team and restarted active development.

The 'Official' in the name is from when the original developers moved on, specifying that this branch-off of their work was the one that was the official port to Arma 3.

## Installation

### Via Steam Workshop (Recommended)

We recommend installing this mod through the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1351428303). We do require [CBA](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=450814997), but this mod should be automatically installed.

### Via Github Releases

To install via Github Releases, you must download a version from our [Releases Page](https://github.com/AH-64D-Apache-Official-Project/AH-64D/releases)

From there, once it is unzipped, you can add `@AH-64D Apache Longbow` as a local mod through the [Arma 3 launcher](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3:_Launcher_-_Mod_Handling).

Make sure you also have CBA installed and active, as the launcher will not automatically handle this dependency when not installing through the workshop.

### From Source (Development versions)

Use of these versions is at your own risk - these versions can be half-complete or intermediate versions that don't meet our standards for release. We recommend for anything other than development / testing to use the other two options.

To build the mod from source, you must use Addon Builder, from [Arma 3 Tools](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233800/Arma_3_Tools/). Use it to build each of the folders within `@AH-64D Apache Longbow/Addons/` with the following settings:

* Binarize enabled
* (Under Options) set the "List of files to copy directly" to the contents of the file `buildExtIncludes.txt`.

From there you can run it as if you had downloaded it [from Github releases](#via-github-releases).

## Support

Learning this aircraft can be difficult, and you will need resources to help you do it. We recommend you take a look at the following areas to learn more about the aircraft:

* Our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rB6yDDy), in particular the `#faq` (Frequently Asked Questions) section.
* Our [wiki](https://github.com/AH-64D-Apache-Official-Project/AH-64D/wiki), which stores long-form information about the aircraft and its systems

### Bugs

Should you find any bugs, please come and talk to us on discord. We would love to discuss the problem with you and ensure that your issue is indeed an issue with the mod. If after this you know it is a bug then please submit an issue on our [issues page](https://github.com/AH-64D-Apache-Official-Project/AH-64D/issues) with as much information as possible.

## Contributing

If you enjoy our mod and wish to give back to the project then we would love to have you on the team! Please come and join us on our discord server and talk to us as that is where the majority of our organisation is done.

The main fields that we are looking for help in are as follows:

* **Programmers** - People who are experienced with the SQF programming language, who would like to work on the systems programming in the aircraft.
* **Artists** - We need people who can make textures and 3D models to work on the aircraft and additional content around it.
* **Documentation writers** - We are trying to expand our wiki, and other content to help us better teach our players about the features we add.
* **Testers** - We need people to test the new content we make, ensuring it all works as expected to the standards we expect.
